      <p>My UX research and design is driven by my background in neuroscience and psychology. I aim to create designs that are truly relevant to my users and are easy and delightful to use.</p>
      <p>Some projects are still in the works and are not listed here. Feel free to contact me for more examples.</p>

          <h2>TruckPark</h2>
          <ul class="skills-container">
            <li>User interviews/research</li>
            <li>User personas</li>
            <li>User flows and journeys</li>
            <li>User testing</li>
            <li>Wireframes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>TruckPark's goal is to solve US truck driver's difficulty of finding safe parking when their 12 hour driving window finishes. If a driver cannot find suitable parking within their 12 hour driving window, s/he violates the Hours of Service legal clause in their contract and can potentially lose their job.</p>
          <p>Truckpark's initially came to my team requesting a prototype to present to investors. Upon discussion, we quickly learned that the company was still unsure about the solution to the problem they were trying to address. I conducted user research and interviews to gain a better understanding of the major concerns and pain points of truck drivers in America, especially given a recent law passed by congress that affected their working hours. After determining the major pain points, we brainstormed system solutions for the company to implement, such as SpotHero’s model.</p>
          <p>Once we refined the company’s model, I set off to create user flows and journeys for the application. I then created a wireframe prototype to conduct individual user testing and to validate user flows. After several design cycles based on user testing, I handed off the refined wireframe prototype to our visual designers to apply the brand styles to the application.</p>

          <h2>Mandatory Provident Fund - Hong Kong</h2>
          <ul class="skills-container">
            <li>User interviews/research</li>
            <li>User personas</li>
            <li>User flows and journeys</li>
            <li>Wireframes</li>
            <li>Website architecture</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Hong Kong government wants to digitize its entire retirement fund system in the next few years. This involves a complex dance between the trustees’ existing online systems, the government’s systems, and the intermediaries.</p>
          <p>I was involved in creating the design and user experience portion of our agency’s proposal. As I recently moved back to Hong Kong, I conducted user interviews and research to develop a better understanding of the pain points of the current system for the mandatory providence fund.</p>
          <p>From my research, I developed multiple user personas, overarching user journeys, website architecture, and high level user flows. I also created wireframes for desktop and mobile versions of the dashboard and conducted informal user testing to iterate on my designs.</p>

          <h2>Crescent Cardboard Company</h2>
          <ul class="skills-container">

            <li>User flows and journeys</li>
            <li>Website architecture</li>
            <li>Wireframes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Crescent Cardboard Company sells a wide range of art materials. They approached my design agency with the goal of redesigning and restructuring their website, as it was extremely challenging to navigate the old design.</p>
          <p>The most important problem to initially address was the site architecture. To redesign the site map, I consulted with multiple people in the company to come up with the best organization. The other biggest challenge was addressing how to make the search and customization process painless for users.</p>
          <p>After applying the new site architecture and proposed solutions to the wireframes, we informally tested the layout on existing customers and random people using a script I wrote. After the final iteration, I handed off the wireframes to our visual designers to create the mock-up. I provided feedback to our visual designers on web accessibility and best design choices for the development team.</p>
          <p>Once the visual design was finalized, I was in charge of the front-end development of the website. The website was built with Big Commerce and Wordpress.</p>

            <li>A/B Testing</li>
            <li>Individual user testing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Albert.io is an education technology company based in Chicago. Intially a platform to prepare students for standardized testing in the US, it has now expanded to multiple academic areas. As the sole designer of the company, I was tasked in creating a portal for teachers and school administrators to keep track of students’ progress and purchased licenses.</p>
          <p>I began by conducting user research and interviews with teachers and administrators. I had a personal connection with my work, as I was a former teacher through Teach for America. This extra degree of empathy really drove my vision for designing the portal.</p>
          <p>I drafted user flows to review with our team and designed a wireframe prototype to conduct individual user testing with some of our customers. Once we validated my designs, I applied our company’s branding to create the mockups on Sketch. As we had a few points of disagreement on the designs within our team, we conducted a couple minor A/B tests to make final design decisions.</p>
